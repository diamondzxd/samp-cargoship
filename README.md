# SAMP Cargoship

A SAMP Filterscript which adds a flying cargoship that follows the specified co-ordinates, then returns back to its original location.

### What is SAMP?

San Andreas multiplayer (https://www.sa-mp.com/) is an unofficial multiplayer modification for the game GTA San Andreas which supports custom scripting features. This filterscript is an example of that which performs a very small function.

### What is a .PWN file?

PWN files are used to represent PAWN scripting(https://github.com/compuphase/pawn).
It is a C-based language, and can be used with SAMP API and plugins to facilitate the development of game scripts.

### How to run this script?

This can be either compiled into .AMX executable using a PAWN compiler setup, or you can simply run the script directly by adding the "cargoship.amx" provided in this repository into the server.cfg of your SAMP server.

Happy Scripting! :)
